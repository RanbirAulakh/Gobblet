########################### MAIN GAME CONFIG ###############################

# List of player modules separated by commas.  
# The number of modules listed here specifies the number of players in the game 
# To play via the GUI, use Human.  
PLAYER_MODULES Human, Human

# Enables multi-client play
REMOTE False

# False = manual - enter advances each move
AUTO_PLAY True

# Animation speed, in milliseconds (lower is faster)
# Below 300 disables animations
# Acceptable values: 1-3000
ANIMATION_SPEED 500

STDOUT_LOGGING True

# PRE_MOVE ---
# Moves to make before the players get control
# This variable is unique in that it can be assigned many consecutive values.
# When a game starts, the moves are executed in the order that they appear
# in this file. They get executed after the players' and engine's init()
# functions are called. Each move performed causes calls to the same notifying
# functions that get called if a player had had its move() function called.
# Note that the programmer must take care to alternate the player ID of each
# successive PRE_MOVE to mimic what would happen in a normal game with the
# number of players specified in PLAYER_MODULES, above.
# The format is that of the PlayerMove constructor.
# Below are listed four sample pre-moves for a 2-player game.
# Uncomment them to use them.
# Format for PlayerMove(playerId, stack, size, start, end)
